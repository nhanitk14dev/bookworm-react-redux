# Bookworm React Redux - TypeScripts

# I. Installation

- Create a new application: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started].
We use "npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript" to create with TypeScript
- Create folder structure for application as recommended:
```
--src
----components
-------Header
-------Footer
----pages // web page screen
-------home
-------blogs
-------portfolio
----providers
----redux
----utils
```
- Download this provided template to create pages:[https://bootstrapmade.com/sailor-free-bootstrap-theme]
- [`Rule define Jsx`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-filename-extension.md)

In the project directory, you can run available Scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

- Other packages:
    + Webpack: [`npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started). It is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
    + Lodash: [`npm i --save lodash`](https://lodash.com)
    A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.
    Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
    + Bootstrap: [`npm install bootstrap`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap/)

- Note:
  + Should use end slash with single tag such as: [`<br/>, <input />, ...`] in React.

## 3. Code Explained

  We wrap our content first with `<BrowserRouter>`.

  Then we define our `<Routes>`. An application can have multiple `<Routes>`. Our basic example only uses one.
  `<Route>`s can be nested. The first `<Route>` has a path of / and renders the Layout component.

  The nested `<Route>`s inherit and add to the parent route. So the blogs path is combined with the parent and becomes /blogs.

  The Home component route does not have a path but has an index attribute. That specifies this route as the default route for the parent route, which is /.
  Setting the path to * will act as a catch-all for any undefined URLs. This is great for a 404 error page.

  The Layout component has `<Outlet>` and `<Link>` elements.
  The `<Outlet>` renders the current route selected.
  `<Link>` is used to set the URL and keep track of browsing history. Anytime we link to an internal path, we will use `<Link>` instead of `<a href="">`. 
  The "layout route" is a shared component that inserts common content on all pages, such as a navigation menu.

  `Suspense` component, which allows us to show some fallback content such as a loading indicator) while weâ€™re waiting for the lazy component to load.
